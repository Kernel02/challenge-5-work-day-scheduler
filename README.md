## Work Day Scheduler

This webpage enables users with a common work schedule of 9AM to 5PM to input and save events per hour blocks on the day of. I took the starter code, which gave the structure and style of the page, and used Day.js to make the page change based on the date and hour of the day. The webpage highlights the current hour red, past hours grey, and future hours green. The webpage also stores the events the user inputs to local storage and loads them onto the page, so long as the day is still the same.
